# Feature Overview
  It's a **Pixel Perfect** landing page is adaptive and responsive.It works correctly on different devices like phone, tablet and desktop versions.

  In this project, I use **BEM** and reuse some blocks to avoid code duplications. I used semantic tags for good structure of page.

  Also styles are implemented using **Sass(SCSS)** and advanced features like mixins, functions, variables and etc.

  User interaction is implemented with hover effects, transition and Javascript.Also page has different animanitions.


# For what?
  I created this page because I wanted to improve my HTML/CSS skills.After practice with more easier layout, I choose more difficult one to realise all knowledge of HTML/CSS.Which I have gained so far along, to make this page more interactive.

  The main goal of this project was to implement difficult design, then I did before and to make it responsive and use **BEM** methodology.I had to use more advanced features **CSS** like flexbox, media queries, grid, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements along **Sass(SCSS)** features like mixins, function, variables and etc.
